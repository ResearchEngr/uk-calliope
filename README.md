# UK-Calliope model

This is the model used to generate the results reported in: Stefan Pfenninger and James Keirstead.  2015.  Renewables, nuclear, or fossil fuels? Scenarios for Great Britain's power system considering costs, emissions and energy security.  _Applied Energy_.  [doi: 10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.04.102](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.04.102)

The model was run with [Calliope framework version 0.3.4](https://github.com/calliope-project/calliope/tree/v0.3.4).

## Overview

The model configuration is in the directory `model_config`.

Simple run configuration files are in `run_config_simple`:

* `run_planning.yaml`: Run model 1 in planning mode with 6-hourly timesteps
* `run_op_2012.yaml`: Run 2012 power system in operational mode

Run configuration files used for Pfenninger and Keirstead (2015) are in `run_config_paper`.

### Zones

![Zone Map](zones.png)

A [shapefile](shapefile.zip) with polygons of the zones used is included.

### Setting up the run environment on a cluster

A `cluster_environment.yaml` file needs to be set up for the cluster computing platform on which the models will be run. See the included `cluster_environment_example.yaml` file.
